Company:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
ID:CT08DS3892
Domain:Python
Duration:July 5-August 5
Project Explanation
Colorama Initialization:

The program imports and initializes the Colorama library, which allows it to print colored text to the console. This makes the user interface more engaging and visually appealing.
Basic Arithmetic Functions:

The program defines four functions to perform basic arithmetic operations:
add(x, y): Adds two numbers and returns the result.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
divide(x, y): Divides the first number by the second. If the second number is zero, it returns an error message to avoid division by zero.
User Interface:

The program prints a welcome message in blue text.
It prompts the user to enter two numbers, which will be used in the calculations.
It then displays a list of available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in yellow text.
User Input for Operation Choice:

The program asks the user to choose an operation by entering a number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
Performing the Chosen Operation:

Based on the user's choice, the program calls the appropriate function to perform the calculation.
It then prints the result of the operation in green text.
If the user enters an invalid choice, the program prints an error message in red text.
Usage Example
The user starts the program and sees a welcome message.
The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
The user is shown a list of operations and prompted to choose one.
The program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: The use of colored text makes the interface more intuitive and visually distinct.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The program can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: The program checks for division by zero and invalid operation choices, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
This simple calculator project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as user input, function definitions, conditional statements, and basic error handling, all while making the interaction more engaging through the use of Colorama.
